Data Science,Mathematics for Machine Learning,https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning,David Dye,"For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.

In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.

The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.

The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.

Health,Bioinformatics,https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics,Pavel  Pevzner,"Join Us in a Top 50 MOOC of All Time!

How do we sequence and compare genomes? How do we identify the genetic basis for disease? How do we construct an evolutionary Tree of Life for all species on Earth?

When you complete this Specialization, you will learn how to answer many questions in modern biology that have become inseparable from the computational approaches used to solve them. You will also obtain a toolkit of existing software resources built on these computational approaches and that are used by thousands of biologists every day in one of the fastest growing fields in science.

Although this Specialization centers on computational topics, you do not need to know how to program in order to complete it. If you are interested in programming, we feature an ""Honors Track"" (called ""hacker track"" in previous runs of the course). The Honors Track allows you to implement the bioinformatics algorithms that you will encounter along the way in dozens of automatically graded coding challenges. By completing the Honors Track, you will be a bioinformatics software professional!

Learn more about the Bioinformatics Specialization (including why we are wearing these crazy outfits) by watching our introductory video.

You can purchase the Specialization's print companion, Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach, from the textbook website.

This specialization also linear models for data science, starting from understanding least squares from a linear algebraic and mathematical perspective, to statistical linear models, including multivariate regression using the R programming language. These courses will give learners a firm foundation in the linear algebraic treatment of regression modeling, which will greatly augment applied data scientists' general understanding of regression models.

This specialization requires a fair amount of mathematical sophistication. Basic calculus and linear algebra are required to engage in the content.","15,709",187

Effectively deploying machine learning models requires competencies more commonly found in technical fields such as software engineering and DevOps. Machine learning engineering for production combines the foundational concepts of machine learning with the functional expertise of modern software development and engineering roles.

The Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization covers how to conceptualize, build, and maintain integrated systems that continuously operate in production. In striking contrast with standard machine learning modeling, production systems need to handle relentless evolving data. Moreover, the production system must run non-stop at the minimum cost while producing the maximum performance. In this Specialization, you will learn how to use well-established tools and methodologies for doing all of this effectively and efficiently.

In this Specialization, you will become familiar with the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of machine learning engineering in production. By the end, you will be ready to employ your new production-ready skills to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology to solve real-world problems.","40,922","2,424"

However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice. To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview.

We will emphasize that plate tectonics—the grand unifying theory of geology—explains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why present-day geologic activity—including a variety of devastating natural disasters such as earthquakes—occur where they do.  We consider volcanoes, types of eruptions, and typical rocks found there.
